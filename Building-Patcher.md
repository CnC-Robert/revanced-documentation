# Revanced Patcher

This is a fork of the patches: [Revanced](https://github.com/RevancedTeam/revanced-patches)

It is made to guide you to build the patches for [Revanced CLI](https://github.com/RevancedTeam/revanced-cli)

## Installation

Installation is fairly easy if you have experience

* Firstly, clone the patcher repository

`git clone https://github.com/RevancedTeam/revanced-patcher`

* Then change the directory to Revanced Patcher

`cd revanced-patcher`

* After that, switch dalvik-patches branch (check if it's merged to mainline, if it did please let me know and skip this)

`git switch dalvik-patches`

* Now build the patcher via Gradle

`gradle build`

## Congratulations! 

It should build now ðŸŽ‰!
