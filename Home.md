## Welcome to the Revanced wiki!

* This is an unofficial beta build wiki for ReVanced CLI (at the moment ReVanced Manager is not released), so not many of the patches available at the moment

But if you still want to try Revanced then I will help you do so.

## Requirements

* **Command-line interface** (doesn't matter, you just need to know a little bit about it)
(You can even build it on Android (without PC) using [Termux](https://termux.com/))

* **Java 8** (1.8.0_XXX, newer versions may create problems)

* **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** (If you are lazy installing it, you can change the commands `gradle` to `./gradlew` throughout the building process (don't forget to `chmod +x gradlew` when you first clone the repository)

You can join the Team's [discord](https://discord.gg/rF2YcEjcrT) for more information regarding the progress of ReVanced
