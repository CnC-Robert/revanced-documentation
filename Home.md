## Welcome to the Revanced wiki!

* This is an unofficial beta build wiki for ReVanced CLI (at the moment ReVanced Manager is not released), so not many of the patches available at the moment

But if you still want to try Revanced then I will help you do so.

## Requirements

* **Command-line interface** (doesn't matter, you just need to know a little bit about it)
(You can even build it on Android (without PC) using [Termux](https://termux.com/).
Will do a Termux guide soon)

* **Java 8** (1.8.0_XXX, newer versions will cause trouble)

* **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** (If you are lazy installing it, you can change the commands `gradle` to `./gradlew` throughout the building process (don't forget to `chmod +x gradlew` when you first clone the repository)

* **[ADB (ANDROID DEBUG BRIDGE)](https://www.xda-developers.com/all-in-one-guide-to-adb/)** (To connect to your Android phone/tablet and install the APK directly, the reason is that ReVanced CLI doesn't automatically build APK unless ADB is used) 

* **[YouTube APK](https://m.apkpure.com/tr/youtube/com.google.android.youtube/download/1528683968-APK-12d9032142caeb9e290a157801b1169e?from=versions%2Fversion)** (To use the CLI, you need to have the YouTube APK, currently 17.14.35 works)
