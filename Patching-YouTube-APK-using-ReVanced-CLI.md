# Patching YouTube using ReVanced CLI

* Assuming you have built [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-the-ReVanced-CLI) and ready to build the YouTube APK

## Setting Up Directory

* (It is recommended to use file explorer for this part, again)

* Create a new folder in root directory called `revanced`

* Copy the builds of both [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-ReVanced-Patches) and [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-the-ReVanced-CLI) (builds are in `build/libs`), paste them into the revanced folder you created and name them `revancedpatches.jar` and `revancedcli.jar` respectively.

* Copy the downloaded YouTube APK into that folder as well and rename it to `youtube.apk`

* Create a new folder inside revanced folder named `output`

Set up [ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/all-in-one-guide-to-adb/) if you haven't already.
