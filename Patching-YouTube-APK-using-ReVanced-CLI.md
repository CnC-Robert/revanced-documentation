# Patching YouTube using ReVanced CLI

* Assuming you have built [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-the-ReVanced-CLI), [ReVanced Patcher](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-ReVanced-Patcher), [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-ReVanced-Patches) and ready to build the YouTube APK

## Setting Up Directory

* (It is recommended to use file explorer for this part, again)

* Create a new folder in root directory called `revanced`

* Copy the builds of both [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-ReVanced-Patches) and [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/CriticalRange/revanced-cli/wiki/Building-the-ReVanced-CLI) (builds are in `build/libs`), paste them into the revanced folder you created and name them `revancedpatches.jar` and `revancedcli.jar` respectively.

* Copy the downloaded YouTube APK into that folder as well and rename it to `youtube.apk`

* Create a new folder inside revanced folder named `output`

Set up [ADB](https://www.xda-developers.com/all-in-one-guide-to-adb/) if you haven't already.

You're ready to go!

## Patching YouTube with ReVanced CLI

* Firstly, get into your terminal and change directory to revanced folder

`cd revanced`

* Then start patching

`java -jar revancedcli.jar -a youtube.apk -p revancedpatches.jar -o output --run-on yourdevicename`

For `yourdevicename*`, type `adb devices` and copy the IP of your device and replace it with `yourdevicename`

If you set ADB correctly, YouTube should be opened in your device, if not, you should have an APK sitting at revanced/output/ named `revanced.apk`, send it to your device and sideload it.

## CongratulationsðŸŽ‰!

You have just patched the YouTube APK and built it into your device
